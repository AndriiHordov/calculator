## 🧠 Notes
- This project was created as a learning experience to:

- Practice DOM manipulation and event handling

- Handle JavaScript-specific quirks (e.g. 0.1 + 0.2, NaN, Infinity)

- Explore parsing expressions and safe evaluation

- Build accessible, multi-mode user interfaces without frameworks

#### ✅ You can freely copy-paste this improved version into your README.md, or tweak it further to match your exact scope.
